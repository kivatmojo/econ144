## Project Prompt:  
For this project you will fit a forecasting model with trend, seasonal dummies, and cycles. You may choose any data of your choice (except any data used in class and/or previous homework assignments) provided your time-series data suggest the presence of all three components. To make sure you capture any dynamics related to cycles, you will need a large time horizon, therefore, you might want to make sure that your observations span at least âˆ¼ 10 years. In addition, since you will also try to fit a VAR model to your data, you will need to have at least two time-series variables, e.g., S&P500 returns from 1985-present and Apple returns from 1985-present with the same frequency.
